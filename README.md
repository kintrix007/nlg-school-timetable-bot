# NLG School Timatable Bot

### This bot script is made for personal use, for Németh László Gimnázium's 11/a grade to be specific.

The concept of the bot is applicable for different schools and timetables as well, since it reads all the school specific data from JSON files.

If you - for some reason - want to use this bot for your school's (online) education, you only need to replace files in the `source/timetable/` and `source/students/` folders.
