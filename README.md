# NLG School Timatable Bot

### This bot script is made for mainly personal use, specifically for Németh László Gimnázium's 11/a grade.

The bot is made so that it can easily be used with different schools, and timetables as well. All the data is read from YAML files.
(By changing the names of the subjects it's also needed to change them in `types.ts`.)
